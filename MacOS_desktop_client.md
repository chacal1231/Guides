# Running the MonetaryUnit client wallet on MacOS, OSX

Running the MUE client on MacOS works very well and can be used for every day wallet uses or as an occastional cold wallet.

Please grab the latest MacOS/OSX client form the Monetary Unit code repository: https://github.com/muecoin/MUECore/releases/latest

### Install the MUE client

Unpack the MacOS zip-file, and drag the 'MonetaryUnit-Qt.app' to your /Applications/ folder.
    

### Start the client

Depending on ytour security settings in MacOS, you may see a secuity warning that you cannot run the program due to an untrusted develloper verification.

In `Finder`, go to your `Applications` and `ctrl-click` or `right-click` on the `MonetaryUnit-QT.app` and choose `open`. Choose to open the app, and the MonetaryUnit client will launch.    

By default, the blockchain and wallet files are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/MonetaryUnitCore`
In this foilder, your wallet.dat file is located. It is your wallet containing your funds. Please keep this file safe and ensure it is backed up properly and securely!
