### Install the MUE client

    Unpack the MacOS zip-file, and drag the 'MonetaryUnit-Qt.app' to your /Applications/ folder.
    

### Start the client

    Depending on ytour security settings in MacOS, you may see a secuity warning that you cannot run the program due to an untrusted develloper verification.
    In Finder, go to your 'Applications' and ctrl-click or right-click on the 'MonetaryUnit-QT.app' and choose 'open'. Choose to open the app, and the MonetaryUnit client will launch.
